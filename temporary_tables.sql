1. Using the example from the lesson, create a temporary table called employees_with_departments that contains first_name, last_name, and dept_name for employees currently with that department. Be absolutely sure to create this table on your own database. If you see "Access denied for user ...", it means that the query was attempting to write a new table to a database that you can only read.

a. Add a column named full_name to this table. It should be a VARCHAR whose length is the sum of the lengths of		the first name and last name columns
b. Update the table so that full name column contains the correct data
c. Remove the first_name and last_name columns from the table.
d. What is another way you could have ended up with this same table?



2. Create a temporary table based on the payment table from the sakila database.

Write the SQL necessary to transform the amount column such that it is stored as an integer representing the number of cents of the payment. For example, 1.99 should become 199.

3. Find out how the current average pay in each department compares to the overall current pay for everyone at the company. In order to make the comparison easier, you should use the Z-score for salaries. In terms of salary, what is the best department right now to work for? The worst?

4. Hint Consider that the following code will produce the z score for current salaries.


-- Returns the historic z-scores for each salary
-- Notice that there are 2 separate scalar subqueries involved
SELECT salary,
    (salary - (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM salaries))
    /
    (SELECT stddev(salary) FROM salaries) AS zscore
FROM salaries;

/* 
BONUS To your work with current salary zscores, determine the overall historic department average salary, the historic overall average, and the historic zscores for salary. Do the zscores for current department average salaries tell a similar or a different story than the historic department salary zscores?*/
